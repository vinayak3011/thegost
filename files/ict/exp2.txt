Step 1 Download xampp  (paste link in browser)

https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/XAMPP%20Windows/8.0.30/xampp-windows-x64-8.0.30-0-VS16-installer.exe

install it fully

open xampp control panel 

enable apache and sql (if sql throws error then check for my sql in pc and uninstall it)




Step 2 setup DVWA on windows

	open C:\xampp\htdocs 
	open terminal in this folder
run this command in opened terminal
	git clone https://github.com/digininja/DVWA.git


	after cloning open dvwa folder 
	go to config folder
u will see config.inc.php.dist file rename it to 
	config.inc.php


open the renamed file in notepad and search for 
	$_DVWA[ 'db_user' ] 
chnge the value to "root"
search for 
	$_DVWA[ 'db_password' ]
change the vale to ""(jo udr likha hai backspace krdo)
save and close

open C:\xampp\php\php.ini
search for 
	allow_url_include 
	allow_url_fopen 
	display_errors 
change the value of all to On  and Make sure the following are enabled (remove ; if present):


search for 
	extension=gd
	extension=mysqli
(remove ; if present)
if not present append in the file

save and close 

open xampp and restart the apache server	



Step 3 Create the DVWA Database

Open your browser

go to
	http://localhost/phpmyadmin

Click "New", enter
	Database name: dvwa
Click Create



step 4 

open burpsuite 
	click next
	click start burp

go to proxy tab at top navbar

enable intercept

click on open browser in burpsuite 

go to
	http://localhost/dvwa

click forward button in burp suite till the website loads in browser of burp
(kuch bhi click kiya na forward pe click krna pdega agge ke steps mein frdwrd click kro mention nhi kruga)

if login page appear 
	username=admin
	password=password

Click "Create / Reset Database"

if login page appear 
	username=admin
	password=password

u will see the dvwa website

in the left tabs go to the 4th Last tab that is DVWA security
set the impossible --> low 
click submit(forward click kroo)

in the left tabs go to brute force tab

login page appear 
	username=admin
	password=admin
(yehi username pass dalnaa)

now in burpsuite in the buttom left u will see somthing like

	GET /dvwa/vulnerabilities/brute/?username=admin&password=admin&Login=Login HTTP/1.1
	Host: localhost
	sec-ch-ua: "Chromium";v="135", "Not-A.Brand";v="8"
	sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0
	sec-ch-ua-platform: "Windows"
	Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
 right click on it

send to intruder 

open the intruder tab besides proxy tab

u will again see

	GET /dvwa/vulnerabilities/brute/?username=admin&password=admin&Login=Login HTTP/1.1
	Host: localhost
	sec-ch-ua: "Chromium";v="135", "Not-A.Brand";v="8"
	sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0
	sec-ch-ua-platform: "Windows"
	Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9


seletct the value of password that is admin

and click add $ button


Step 4 


create a password.txt file on desktop of system

conten of file
	12345
	admin
	ghost
	password
	system
sve and close the file



step 5 

in burpsuite at the right there is vertical nav bar 
click on payloads tab in it

in payload configuration section click load 
load the password.txt file on desktop


step 6

in same vertical nav bar there is setting tab click on it

scroll down navigate         *Grep match*

click the clear button if prompt appear click yes

after clearing

in the add section paste 
	Username and/or password incorrect.
click add


click on the start attack button at the top left 


doneeeeee

1. What is a Brute Force Attack?
	A Brute Force Attack is a trial-and-error method used to decode encrypted data such as passwords or Data Encryption Standard (DES) keys through exhaustive effort (using brute force) rather than employing intellectual strategies.
	In web applications, brute force attacks are used to guess login credentials by systematically submitting many combinations of usernames and passwords.

2.Burp Suite Overview
	Burp Suite is a popular web vulnerability scanner and proxy tool used by penetration testers to analyze and attack web applications. Key features include:
	Intercepting Proxy
	Intruder (used for brute force)
	Repeater
	Scanner (in Pro version)

3.XAMPP Overview
	XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting of:
	X (Cross-platform)
	Apache (Web Server)
	MySQL/MariaDB (Database)
	PHP
	Perl
	Used to host DVWA locally for testing.

4. DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
	DVWA is a deliberately insecure web app created for testing vulnerabilities like:
	SQL Injection
	XSS
	CSRF
	Brute Force
	File Upload, etc.
	It allows users to practice ethical hacking in a controlled local environment.


********************Viva Questions with Answers*************************
Q1. What is DVWA and why is it used?
Ans: DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) is a PHP/MySQL web application that is vulnerable by design. It is used for testing and practicing various web vulnerabilities in a legal environment.

Q2. What is XAMPP and its components?
Ans: XAMPP is a free server stack that provides Apache, MySQL, PHP, and Perl. It helps developers run a web server locally to test applications.

Q3. What is a Brute Force Attack?
Ans: It is a method of trying all possible combinations of passwords or usernames until the correct one is found.

Q4. What is Burp Suite used for?
Ans: Burp Suite is a tool used in web application security testing. It allows intercepting, modifying, and replaying requests, and has tools like Intruder for attacks like brute force.

Q5. Which module of Burp Suite is used for Brute Force?
Ans: The Intruder module is used to perform brute force and fuzzing attacks by automating requests with different payloads.

Q6. How can you identify a successful login during a brute force attack?
Ans: By analyzing the response length, HTTP status code, or response content which differs when login is successful (e.g., redirect to dashboard).

Q7. What are the types of attack modes in Intruder?
Ans:
	Sniper – one payload position at a time.
	Battering Ram – one payload set applied to all positions.
	Pitchfork – multiple payloads in parallel.
	Cluster Bomb – multiple payloads combined in all combinations.

Q8. How can you secure a web application from brute force attacks?
Ans:
	Rate limiting
	Account lockout after multiple attempts
	CAPTCHA
	Two-factor authentication
	Strong password policies

Q9. Can Burp Suite be used on live websites?
Ans: No, unless you have explicit permission. Otherwise, it is considered illegal and unethical.

Q10. What is the default login for DVWA?
Ans: Username: admin, Password: password
