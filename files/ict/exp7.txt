open kali 

open terminal

type "nmap -sn <target ip>"  (ping scan)
	nmap -sn 
	*Used to check if a host is alive (up) without scanning ports.
	*Does not send SYN packets, only ICMP Echo Requests.

type "nmap -sA <target ip>"  (ACK scan)
	nmap -sA
	*Used to bypass firewalls and determine whether a port is filtered or unfiltered.
	*If a RST (reset) response is received, the port is unfiltered.
	*If no response, the port is filtered

type "nmap -sS <target ip>"  (SYN scan)
	nmap -sS
	*Sends a SYN packet to the target port and waits for a response.
	*If SYN-ACK is received, the port is open.
	*If RST (reset) is received, the port is closed.
	*If there is no response, the port is filtered.

type "nmap -sN <target ip>"  (NULL scan)
	nmap -sN
	*Sends a packet with no flags set.
	*If there is no response, the port is open.
	*If an RST packet is received, the port is closed.

type "nmap -sX <target ip>"  (XMAS scan)
	nmap -sX
	*Sends a packet with FIN, URG, and PUSH flags set (like a Christmas tree).
	*If there is no response, the port is open.
	*If an RST packet is received, the port is closed.


Type "nmap -sF <target ip>" (FIN Scan)
	nmap -sF

Type "nmap -sS --scanflags SYNFIN -T4 youtube.com" (A SYN/FIN scan)
	nmap -sS --scanflags SYNFIN -T4

*****************THEORY***********************


1. PING Scan (Host Discovery)
	Purpose: 
	To check if a host (target system) is alive (reachable) on the network.

	Working: 
	Sends ICMP Echo Request, TCP SYN to port 443, or an ARP Request depending on the network.
	No port scanning is done, only identifies which machines are up.
	Nmap option: -sn

	Example:
	nmap -sn 192.168.1.1

	Usage:
	 Before port scanning, to avoid scanning offline hosts.

2. SYN Scan (Half-open Scan / Stealth Scan)
	Purpose:
	To detect open, closed, or filtered ports in a fast and stealthy way.
	
	Working:
	Sends a SYN packet to the target port.
	If the port is open, target replies with SYN-ACK.
	Nmap immediately sends RST (Reset) to terminate (not completing 3-way handshake).

	Stealthy: 
	Because it never fully opens a TCP connection.
	Nmap option: -sS

	Example:
	sudo nmap -sS 192.168.1.1

	Usage: 
	Default and recommended scan type when you have root privileges.

3. ACK Scan
	Purpose: 
	Used mainly to map firewall rules and identify filtered vs unfiltered ports.

	Working:
	Sends an ACK packet (which normally should only be a reply).	
	If no response or ICMP unreachable comes, port is filtered.	
	If an RST response comes, port is unfiltered (reachable but maybe closed).
	Nmap option: -sA

	Example:
	sudo nmap -sA 192.168.1.1

	Usage: 
	To check if firewalls are present and how they are configured.

4. NULL Scan
	Purpose: 
	To evade simple firewall rules and identify open/closed ports without using standard flags.

	Working:
	Sends a TCP packet with no flags set (empty flag field).	
	Behavior depends on the system:
	Open ports usually do not reply.
	Closed ports usually send RST.
	Nmap option: -sN

	Example:
	sudo nmap -sN 192.168.1.1

	Usage: 
	Firewall evasion and stealth testing.

	Note: May not work properly on Windows targets because Windows follows TCP RFC differently.

5. XMAS Scan
	Purpose: 
	Also used for stealth and firewall evasion.

	Working:
	Sends a TCP packet with FIN, PSH, and URG flags set â€” like "lights flashing" (hence "XMAS").	
	Open ports: No response.
	Closed ports: RST response.
	Nmap option: -sX

	Example:
	sudo nmap -sX 192.168.1.1



ðŸ“¢ Extra Important Points to Say in Viva:
		SYN Scan is the most common for normal port scanning.
		ACK Scan is not for finding open ports, it's for firewall mapping.	
		NULL and XMAS scans are stealth techniques but can be detected by modern firewalls.
		Ping Scan is not a port scan, it's a host discovery method.
